            <h2>ENOUGH</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I knew I was ENOUGH after being picked on a team for a scrimmage game with all boys.
              “Who, ME?” I asked, while sitting on the bleachers of a local Boys and Girls Club. My grandpa always told me I was good enough to play with ANYBODY, but the boys???!!!
              I mean I guess they weren’t that much bigger or faster than me. Definitely not better than this little bear.
              At least, I ought to think so. “Yes, YOU! I want you on my team.”

            <h2>LOVED</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My family never denies a chance to celebrate me and all my endeavors.
              No accomplishment is too small for them.
              I knew I was LOVED after my first year of playing.
              I remember my mom calling the contractor to come pour concrete in our backyard for an outside court.
              I was so excited to invite my cousins to come out and play. And of course, they did.
              It seemed like every weekend we were memorializing something new or maybe that was just the smell of my Papa’s grill that kept me excited.

            <h2>STRONG</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My most memorable basketball moments were those with my AAU team.
              I couldn’t think of anything better than traveling state to state playing the game of basketball with a group of girls I called my family.
              Training, hanging out with my teammates, and winning games was my life. I mean all the conditioning and two-a-day practices were worth it, right?
              I found out how STRONG I really was when training with the shoe junky. “You can be faster than that!” “Ahh, it ain’t that heavy.”
              Trust me, IT WAS HEAVY. But I loved being pushed to what I thought was ‘my limit’.
              But in reality, limits only exist in your mind.

            <h2>LEADER</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I tried so many times to deny my natural capabilities of leading. I just did not want to be “The One”.
              But no matter where I went, there was always someone looking to me for guidance.
              I knew I was a LEADER when it was no longer a challenge to hold myself and teammates accountable. I became more aware of my influence and ability to impact others around me in a positive light.

            <h2>CREATOR</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I knew I was a CREATOR after the series of spin moves I was able to execute consistently with ease.
              With any art form, it takes discipline and perseverance to perfect your craft. The game of basketball deserves diligent players.
              By becoming a steward of the game through late night gym runs and film sessions, I was awarded success in return on and off the court. This encouraged me to conduct creativity in every aspect of my life.
